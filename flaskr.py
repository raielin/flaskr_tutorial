# -------------------------------------
# NOTES:
# -------------------------------------

# from_object() looks at given object (will import it if it's a string) and then look for all uppercase variables defined there. in this case, the 'configuration' section directly above, but could also be from a separate file.

# alternative to from_object() is from_envvar(). allows you to load a configuration from a configurable file.
    # app.config.from_envvar('FLASKR_SETTINGS', silent=True)
        # a user can sent an environment variable called FLASKR_SETTINGS to specifiy a config file to be loaded which will override the default values. the silent switch tells Flask not to complain if no such environment key is set.

# closing() helper function used in database initialization allows connection to stay open for duration of the `with` block.

# app.open_resource() supports ability to operate for duration of the `with` block inherently, so can be used in `with` block directly.
    # opens file from the resource location (in this case, our flaskr directory) and allows the program to read from it. in this case, we are using it to execute a script on the database connection which is saved in `schema.sql`.

# db.commit() to commit changes. SQLite 3 and other transactional databases will not commit unless you explicityly tell it to.

# TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE: if you get an exception later that a table cannot be found check that you did call the init_db function and that your table names are correct (singular vs. plural for example).

# after_request() functions are called after a request and passed the response that will be sent to the client. they have to return the response object or a different one. they are not guaranteed to be executed if an exception is raised - therefore better to use teardown_request().

# teardown_request() functions are not allowed to modify the request and their return values are ignored. if an exception occurred during the request, it is passed to each function; otherwise, None is passed in.

# special `g` object Flask provides to store current DB connection - stores info for one request only and is available from within each function. **never store DB connection in other objects - would not work with threaded environments.

# SECURITY NOTE: use question marks when building SQL statements (like with g.db.execute in add_entry() function). otherwise app will be vulnerable to SQL injection when using string formatting to build SQL statements.

# Jinja provides access to missing attributes and items of objects/dicts, even if there is no `logged_in` key in session.
# with Jinja, the `session` dict is available in the template - can use that to check if user is logged in or not
